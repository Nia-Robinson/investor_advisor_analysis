# Project Title: Investor Advisor Application

This project includes a Jupyter notebook that contains the code for an analysis of investment in both cryptocurrency and stocks using the Monte Carlo simulation.

Additionally, a command line application is included to take an initial monthly investment and determine the current portfolio's worth based on the last 3 years.

Final Analysis:
---

When analyzing the initial monthly investment of $1800, we split the investment 50/50 across both Bitcoin and S&P 500 ETF. 

Based on the last 3 years to today, a $900 BTC investment would produce a total current BTC coins of 2.08038. As of 8/24/2022 (4:43 PM EST), the price of BTC is $21,711.49. The total current Bitcoin wallet would be worth $45,168.14 (USD).

Based on the last 3 years to today, a $900 SPY investment would produce a total current SPY shares of 93.73168. As of 8/24/2022 (4:43 PM EST), the price of SPY is $413.67. The total current S&P 500 ETF wallet would be worth $38,773.98 (USD).

With a combined portfolio of both cryptocurrency and stock, the total value of the portfolio would be worth $83,942.13 (USD). Although the initial investment was a 50/50 split, Bitcoin outperformed the S&P 500 ETF by 7.6%.

When analyzing the performance of the 10-year aggressive investment, the cryptocurrency was weighted by 80%, and the stock was weighted by 20%. There is a 95% chance that an initial investment of $1800 in the portfolio over the next 10 years will end within the range of $1187.45 and $1,666,283.18.

We can conclude that weighting the portfolio more heavily to Bitcoin over the S&P 500 ETF will allow the investor to retire after only 10 years if the volatility of cryptocurrency stays low.
